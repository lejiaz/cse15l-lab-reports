1. Installing VScode: I installed the vs code by clicking a link of their website. Then a document is in my download and I just opened it and install it.
2. Remotely Connecting: I usd ssh  cs15lsp22axe@ieng6.ucsd.edu which includes my own account name and ucsd to be connected remotely.
3. Trying Some Commandsz: I tried ls, it made me see the files on my computer. Then ls -la, it shows more specifically with time and ls -lat it shows those files order by time.
4. Moving Files with scp: At first, my file was not on the right directory. So I use the command cd with the file name and direct to the correct file step by step. 
5. Setting an SSH Key: I remove ssh from the remote account and then use ssh-keygen command and add it in my local account. Then I use mkdir .ssh to make directory to the remote account and then log out my account. Then I used scp to copy the file from remote to my computer. And put public inside so that I don't need to enter password anymore.
6. Optimizing Remote Running: I used ssh with my account+"ls" instead of ssh with my account then use ls command. And it save more time. What's more, to complie and run the WhereAmI.java efficiently, I put javac and java toghter in one line and separate those with";". It make me save more time on running these code.
