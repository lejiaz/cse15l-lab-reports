 by adding a while loop including current index and old current index that's Arella that doesn't show the next line fixed.
# Relationship2
the input was failed because of the relationship of current index and old current index are not carified.And we are not able to break. The symptom is that the output running twice which was supposed to be once. And the bug is what I mentioned before. The bug causes the symption.
# Relationship3
It shows the first line again. That is because we didn't add a remove command to the while loop.
